# The Tvorog Mod

A Minecraft mod (requires Fabric API) that adds cottage cheese (or, more precisely, tvorog — rus. творог, aka the best food on the planet) to the game

## Disclaimer
This is my very first Minecraft mod, and a lot of other features (inluding other dairy products) are planned!

## Disclaimer 2
You absolutely _CAN_ use this mod even if you are lactose intolerant :)

## Gameplay

- Grab your bucket, go to your (or somebody else's) cows and get some of that delicious raw milk
- Get yourself a nice little cauldron and fill it with lava
- Produce some milk whey by right-clicking the cauldron (filled with lava) holding a bucket of milk
- Then, craft your delicious fresh cottage cheese combining an empty bucket with two portions of milk whey in the crafting interface

Right-click a sweet berries bush to add some extra sweetness on top!

## Other features
- Feed milk whey to a chicken to give it some of that pROtEIn boost, which will immediately give you an egg :)

## Plans
- other dairy products (yogurt, пасха, etc.)
- whey protein powder..? ;-)
