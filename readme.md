# The Tvorog Mod

A Minecraft mod (requires Fabric API) that adds cottage cheese (or, more precisely, tvorog — rus. творог, aka the best food on the planet) to the game

## Disclaimer
This is my very first Minecraft mod, and a lot of other features (inluding other dairy products) are planned!

## Disclaimer 2
You absolutely _CAN_ use this mod even if you are lactose intolerant :)

## Gameplay

### Make your own fresh Tvorog!
- Grab your bucket, go to your (or somebody else's) cows and get some of that delicious raw milk
- Get yourself a nice little cauldron and fill it with lava
- Produce some milk whey by right-clicking the cauldron (filled with lava) holding a bucket of milk
- Then, craft your delicious fresh cottage cheese combining an empty bucket with two portions of milk whey in the crafting interface

Tvorog provides you with amazing amount of saturation and fights your hunger!

### Sweeten it :)
- Right-click a sweet berries bush to add some extra sweetness on top!

Although it's sweet, the saturation is a tiny bit smaller as if you ate a portion of plain unsweetened tovorg. It's sugar crash, baby!

### Use the POWER of Whey Protein
- Feed milk whey to a chicken to give it some of that pROtEIn boost, which will immediately reward you with an egg :)

## Plans
- other dairy products (yogurt, пасха, etc.)
- whey protein powder..? ;-)
